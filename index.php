		<h1>Ben Reid</h1>
		<p style="text-indent: 20px">
			You ever have to write something about yourself, but you have no idea where to start? Yeah me neither,
			totally on top of that. Now that the first sentence is out of the way, I'm Ben Reid. I have a B.S. in computer
			engineering from the University at Buffalo, as well as a B.A. in mathematics from there. I work as a software
			engineer, but also enjoy programming and tinkering outside of work for fun. I love video games as well, both
			playing and creating. The desire to make games is what got me into programming, and my career, and is still
			alive and well today
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 20px">
			Outside of nerdy computer things, I enjoy photography, model aircraft construction and flying, SCUBA diving and
			traveling. I spend a lot of time trying to decide which hobby to pursue at any given time, especially when I start
			trying to tackle multiple projects at once. Unfortunately all of my hobbies are quite expensive, so I tend to program
			the most as its free to do and independant of location and weather.
